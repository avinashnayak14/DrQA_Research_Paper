# COS 495 Final Project

Represents the work I did with two project teammates (Kai Lu and Nava Vaikuntan) for our COS 495 NLP class. I have uploaded our paper, but not our code, because this work was done as part of a class (not research), and hence we would not like it to be replicated. If you are interested in our code, feel free to get in touch.
